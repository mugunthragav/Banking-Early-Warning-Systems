# User Guide

Welcome to the Credit Risk Analysis application. This guide explains how to run the application and understand its functionality.

### **1. Running the Application**

After completing the `installation.md` guide, you can start the backend server.

1.  Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the following command from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    * This command starts the web server. The `--reload` flag makes it automatically restart when you make code changes.
    * The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### **2. Using the Frontend**

This project has an Angular frontend for a user-friendly experience.

1.  Start the Angular development server (typically on another terminal).
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL: `http://localhost:4200/Market-risk`.
3.  You can use the web interface to upload a file with loan data or fill out a form to get predictions.

### **3. How It Works: A High-Level Overview**

1.  **Data Input**: You provide loan application data through the frontend or by directly calling the API.
2.  **Processing**: The backend cleans and preprocesses the data.
3.  **ML Models**: The data is passed through three machine learning models to predict:
    * **Probability of Default (PD)**: The likelihood a borrower will not be able to repay the loan.
    * **Loss Given Default (LGD)**: The percentage of the loan that will be lost if the borrower defaults.
    * **Exposure at Default (EAD)**: The estimated loan balance at the time of default.
4.  **Calculation**: An **Expected Loss (EL)** is calculated using the outputs of the three models.
5.  **Database Logging**: All input data and prediction results are saved to the `application_logs` table in the MySQL database.
6.  **AI Interpretation**: A summary of the results is generated by an AI model to provide a simple, human-readable explanation.
7.  **Response**: The final aggregated metrics, individual results, and AI summary are sent back to you.
